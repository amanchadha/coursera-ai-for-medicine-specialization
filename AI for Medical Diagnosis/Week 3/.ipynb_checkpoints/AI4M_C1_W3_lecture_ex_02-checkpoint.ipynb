    "In the assignment you will be extracting sub-sections of the MRI data to train your network. The reason for this is that training on a full MRI scan would be too memory intensive to be practical. To extract a sub-section in the assignment, you will need to write a function to isolate a small \"cube\" of the data for training. This example is meant to show you how to do such an extraction for 1D arrays. In the assignment you will apply the same logic in 3D."
